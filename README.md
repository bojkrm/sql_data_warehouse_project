**Data Warehouse and Analytics Project with Zubair**

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

**Data Architecture**
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers: Data Architecture

  1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into the SQL Server Database.
  2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardisation, and normalisation processes to prepare data for analysis.
  3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modelled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.


**Project Overview**
This project involves:

  1. Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
  2. ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
  3. Data Modelling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimised for analytical queries.
  4. Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

**Project Requirements**
Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

**Objective**
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

**Specifications**
  > Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
  > Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
  > Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
  > Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
  > Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
  > BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

**Objective**
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

  > Customer Behaviour
  > Product Performance
  > Sales Trends
These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
